h1. How to use it

p. All this examples are generated in test/test_technical_readme.rb.

h2. Simple graph

p. First thing we need to have data to show on graph, for example something like:

<pre>
<code>
simple_data_array = [
  { :x => 0, :y => 0 },
  { :x => 1, :y => 1 },
  { :x => 2, :y => 2 },
  { :x => 3, :y => 2 },
  { :x => 4, :y => 1 },
  { :x => 5, :y => 0 },
]
</code>
</pre>

p. If you want to put this data on graph you need to create TechnicalGraph object

<pre>
<code>
tg = TechnicalGraph.new
</code>
</pre>

p. and add a layer.

<pre>
<code>
tg.add_layer(simple_data_array)
</code>
</pre>

p. We added data but we don't see anything. Now we have to render graph and save it to file.

<pre>
<code>
tg.render
file_name = 'samples/readme/01_simplest.png'
@tg.image_drawer.save_to_file(file_name)
</code>
</pre>

p. And we got our first graph with one layer without any options changes, a bit raw.
